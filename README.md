# CLOCS-MasterThesis
This is the implementation of Master Thesis using CLOCs: Camera-LiDAR Object Candidates Fusion for 3D Object Detection as the baseline architecture.
The aim is to improve the existing object detection fusion network for sequential data by adding reccurent layers like LSTM and carry features from previous time steps to next.

CLASSES detected: Car, Pedestrian, Cyclist
